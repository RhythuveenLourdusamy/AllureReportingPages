Score: 1.0
Reason: The score is 1.00 because every element of the expected output is perfectly reflected in the 1st node in the retrieval context, indicating a flawless recall.

Score: 1.0
Reason: The score is 1.00 because the output is fully relevant to the input with no irrelevant statements.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.8, strict: False, evaluation model: azure openai, reason: The score is 1.00 because every element of the expected output is perfectly reflected in the 1st node in the retrieval context, indicating a flawless recall., error: None)
  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.6, strict: False, evaluation model: azure openai, reason: The score is 1.00 because the output is fully relevant to the input with no irrelevant statements., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Get me contacts who are members of the list 'freshchat-MakeMyTrip PDF Request'.
  - actual output: {
    "condition": "AND",
    "matchGroups": [
        {
            "condition": "AND",
            "matches": [
                {
                    "type": "list_membership",
                    "condition": "AND",
                    "criteria": {
                        "id": 1805,
                        "resourceMatchType": "specificResource",
                        "operation": "eq"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
  - expected output: {"condition": "AND", "matchGroups": [{"matches": [{"type": "list_membership", "filters": [], "criteria": {"id": "1805", "operation": "eq", "resourceMatchType": "specificResource"}, "condition": "AND"}], "condition": "AND"}]}
  - context: None
  - retrieval context: ['{\n    "condition": "AND",\n    "matchGroups": [\n        {\n            "condition": "AND",\n            "matches": [\n                {\n                    "type": "list_membership",\n                    "condition": "AND",\n                    "criteria": {\n                        "id": 1805,\n                        "resourceMatchType": "specificResource",\n                        "operation": "eq"\n                    }\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}']
