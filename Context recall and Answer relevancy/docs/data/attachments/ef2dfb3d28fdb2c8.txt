Score: 0.75
Reason: The score is 0.75 because key elements such as 'condition' and 'matchGroups' from sentence 1, and 'matches', 'type', and 'condition' from sentence 2 align with the structure from node 1 in the retrieval context. However, the specific 'id' value in the expected output does not match the 'id' in the retrieval context.

Score: 1.0
Reason: The score is 1.00 because the response fully addressed the input without any irrelevant information.

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Contextual Recall (score: 0.75, threshold: 0.8, strict: False, evaluation model: azure openai, reason: The score is 0.75 because key elements such as 'condition' and 'matchGroups' from sentence 1, and 'matches', 'type', and 'condition' from sentence 2 align with the structure from node 1 in the retrieval context. However, the specific 'id' value in the expected output does not match the 'id' in the retrieval context., error: None)
  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.6, strict: False, evaluation model: azure openai, reason: The score is 1.00 because the response fully addressed the input without any irrelevant information., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Get me contacts who are members of the list 'freshservice-FS Frameworks Whitepaper'
  - actual output: {
    "condition": "AND",
    "matchGroups": [
        {
            "condition": "AND",
            "matches": [

  - expected output: {"condition": "AND", "matchGroups": [{"matches": [{"type": "list_membership", "filters": [], "criteria": {"id": "1322", "operation": "eq", "resourceMatchType": "specificResource"}, "condition": "AND"}], "condition": "AND"}]}
