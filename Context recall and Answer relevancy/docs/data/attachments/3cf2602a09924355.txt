Score: 0.75
Reason: The score is 0.75 because the expected output closely follows the structure and conditions specified in the 1st node in retrieval context, such as starting with '{"condition": "AND"...' and mentioning 'list_membership'. However, the specific 'id' value '4799' does not correspond to any 'id' in the retrieval context, which prevents a perfect score.

Score: 1.0
Reason: The score is 1.00 because the output fully addressed the input with no irrelevant statements.

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Contextual Recall (score: 0.75, threshold: 0.8, strict: False, evaluation model: azure openai, reason: The score is 0.75 because the expected output closely follows the structure and conditions specified in the 1st node in retrieval context, such as starting with '{"condition": "AND"...' and mentioning 'list_membership'. However, the specific 'id' value '4799' does not correspond to any 'id' in the retrieval context, which prevents a perfect score., error: None)
  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.6, strict: False, evaluation model: azure openai, reason: The score is 1.00 because the output fully addressed the input with no irrelevant statements., error: None)

For test case:
