        "reason": "The id in the expected output '1868' does not match the id '1388' in the 1st node of the retrieval context."
    }
]


Score: 0.0
Reason: The score is 0.00 because the id '1868' specified in sentence 1 of the expected output does not correspond to any id within the nodes in the retrieval context, specifically mismatching with '1388' in node 1.

Score: 0.7
Reason: The score is 0.70 because the repeated irrelevant use of 'condition: AND' does not contribute useful information specific to the requested list of contacts, although the response is somewhat on-topic.

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Contextual Recall (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.8, strict: False, evaluation model: azure openai, reason: The score is 0.00 because the id '1868' specified in sentence 1 of the expected output does not correspond to any id within the nodes in the retrieval context, specifically mismatching with '1388' in node 1., error: None)
  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.7, threshold: 0.6, strict: False, evaluation model: azure openai, reason: The score is 0.70 because the repeated irrelevant use of 'condition: AND' does not contribute useful information specific to the requested list of contacts, although the response is somewhat on-topic., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Get me contacts who are members of the list 'freshservice-FS AI in ITSM eBook'
  - actual output: {
    "condition": "AND",
    "matchGroups": [
        {
            "condition": "AND",
            "matches": [
                {
                    "type": "list_membership",
                    "condition": "AND",
                    "criteria": {
                        "id": 1388,
                        "resourceMatchType": "specificResource",
                        "operation": "eq"

                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
  - expected output: {"condition": "AND", "matchGroups": [{"matches": [{"type": "list_membership", "filters": [], "criteria": {"id": "1868", "operation": "eq", "resourceMatchType": "specificResource"}, "condition": "AND"}], "condition": "AND"}]}
  - context: None
  - retrieval context: ['{\n    "condition": "AND",\n    "matchGroups": [\n        {\n            "condition": "AND",\n            "matches": [\n                {\n                    "type": "list_membership",\n                    "condition": "AND",\n                    "criteria": {\n                        "id": 1388,\n                        "resourceMatchType": "specificResource",\n                        "operation": "eq"\n                    }\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}']
